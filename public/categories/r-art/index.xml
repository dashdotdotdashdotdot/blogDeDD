      <description>Artists have long been fascinated with the concepts of figure and ground reversals. In this note, we show how to execute such techniques with mathematical operations on photographs. We will start with two images. The image on the left is one of a chess board. It is a photograph that I have taken. The image on the right is &amp;ldquo;Silhouet van Madame Eug√®ne de Block-Looz,&amp;rdquo; which is a &amp;ldquo;snipping&amp;rdquo; done by Charles Auguste Fraikin in 1852 and is available on website of the Rijks Museum.</description>

The animation that this program produces is posted on the instagram site of @dashdotdotdashdot: instagram. The idea is to run it once at a low resolution first with a small number of frames to see that it works before committing to creating a relatively large .</description>
