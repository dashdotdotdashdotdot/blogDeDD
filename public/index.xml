      <description>Artists have long been fascinated with the concepts of figure and ground reversals. In this note, we show how to execute such techniques with mathematical operations on photographs. We will start with two images. The image on the left is one of a chess board. It is a photograph that I have taken. The image on the right is &amp;ldquo;Silhouet van Madame Eugène de Block-Looz,&amp;rdquo; which is a &amp;ldquo;snipping&amp;rdquo; done by Charles Auguste Fraikin in 1852 and is available on website of the Rijks Museum.</description>

      <description>Introduction Figure 1: Escher’s Sphere Escher created three dimensional spaces that never existed with mathematical precision. He also was very good at conveying a sense of depth on a flat surface. All without the aid of a computer.
About this sphere (made in 1958) he wrote: “Curved ribbons or strips are suited to suggest a three dimensionality… A system of four theoretically never ending ribbons running over the surface of the sphere linking at the poles.</description>

      <description>This notebook shows how to use some of the tools in the package aPhotoDeDD.^[current location is (https://github.com/dashdotdotdashdotdot/aPhotoDeDD)] As this is an R Notebook, you can read the .html version on a browser or you can bring up the .Rmd version in Rstudio and run it line by line and make changes as desired. The animation that this program produces is posted on the instagram site of @dashdotdotdashdot: instagram. The idea is to run it once at a low resolution first with a small number of frames to see that it works before committing to creating a relatively large .</description>
